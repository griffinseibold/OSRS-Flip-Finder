# Old School Runescape Flip-Finder
This program utilizes the Runescape Grand Exchange Market Watch API to populate
a local database with item information. This can then be used by players to
determine which items are profitable to "flip". Flipping is when you buy an item
for it's current selling price and then sell it at it's current buying price.
The gap between those two prices should be profitable for a "flip" to be succesful.

## TODO
Create a Frontend
Add functionality for on-demand refreshing of items
