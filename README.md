# OSRS Flip Finder

Flip Finder ranks Old School RuneScape Grand Exchange items by how much you
could make flipping them after tax, using live prices from the RuneScape Wiki.
Set a budget and it shows the best flips you can afford, how fast each one is
trading, and what one four-hour buy limit of it could earn.

## Run it on your computer

You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).

```bash
docker run --rm --publish 8081:8080 ghcr.io/griffinseibold/osrs-flip-finder:latest
```

Open <http://localhost:8081>. Prices load a few seconds after it starts and
refresh every five minutes. Press Ctrl+C to stop it.

## Run it on the homelab

The homelab version knows your account and adds a chat with the homelab's
local language model: ask what to flip and it answers for your coins,
membership and buy limits, and whether an item is trading more than usual.
You need:

- a running [homelab]
- [RuneLite](https://runelite.net) with the
  [Flip Finder Agent](https://github.com/griffinseibold/flip-finder-plugin)
  plugin

Register Flip Finder with the homelab's Argo CD once:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-homelab-dev apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/griffinseibold/Flip-Finder/master/deploy/argocd-application.yaml
```

Then set up the plugin: in RuneLite, install **Flip Finder Agent** from the
Plugin Hub, turn on its **Send account data** setting, and open your bank
once.
[RuneLite plugin](docs/runelite-plugin.md) has the details.

Open <http://flipfinder.localhost:8080>. It opens on the **Chat** tab; **All
flips** has the full table. Argo CD keeps it in step with this repository from
then on, and its price database survives restarts.
